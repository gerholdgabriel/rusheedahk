One thing that I really like about macOS (which I've used on my work computer) is iTerm2 - specifically the quake style drop down terminal As a part of my workflow on macOS, I've gotten into the habit that, once I move focus from the terminal (by using the mouse or keyboard to switch to a different application / window), I expect the drop down terminal to hide To mimic this action, you can configure these terminals to "hide when they lose focus" in the preferences, but what ends up happening. 8 ноя 2013 .

I'm pulling my hair out and could use help, please. My previous laptop, a Toshiba Satellite 2-in-1, is literally falling apart. I would often pick it up and a screw would literally fall apart, and one of the hinges has completely broken apart and two wires are sticking out. It can't even connect to wifi now. It had a glossy touch screen. I realized I don't ever use the tablet mode or the touch screen so that's not necessary anymore.

Будет ли сборка работать на MacOS или Linux. Hi everyone! I’m a newbie to macs in general, and this mod had zero issues on my PC, but running quake 1.5 on my 2018 MacBook Pro i7 has been somewhat of an issue. I’ve got it physically going to the menus, and I can load any map, but for some reason I can’t start a single player campaign, or even see the slip gate complex. A menu appears telling me to hit backspace to load maps or hit home to access commands, which is fine, but the screen space other than that text and the HUD is totally black.

I've been a software engineer for ten years so I've been around computers a good amount. and for multiple jobs I've worked, I had to do so on a Windows workstation.

Greetings, I am doings some compatibility tests with Enemy Territory: Quake Wars which is a FPS released in 2007. The game natively ported to Mac by Aspyr and I have that version which natively runs on Mac just fine. However, I need to run the Windows version of the game to conduct some compatibility tests. As it is an id Tech 4 game (aka Doom 3 engine) which uses OpenGL, I expected it to run on Mac via WINE just fine but it didn't. I tried to run the game with WINE bu using PlayOnMac.

I know you can somehow fake it with iTerm2 but it's still nothing when compared with Yakuake that is 100% drop down terminal and nothing else. Why is that? Is there some macOS catch or there is no demand for such stand alone drop down terminal for Macs? EDIT: This question is about the pheomenon of the lack of dedicated drop down terminals on Mac. I don't need to tell I should use iTerm2. I am very familiar with iTerm2. I just want to know why there are no DEDICATED drop-down terminals. \ \ \ Total budget and country of purchase:\ \ 00, USA \ \ \ Do you prefer a 2 in 1 form factor, good battery life or best specifications for the money?

I finally got my hands on an OEM Geforce 4 Ti, which is now resting in a dual 1.25ghz FW400 MDD. I got Mac OS 9 running on it and I'm trying to remember which games were available that could put it through the paces on OS 9. I remember Unreal Tournament and Quake 3, but those were a bit older. There was American McGee's Alice and Heavy Metal FAKK. I think Rune as well, all based on an enhanced Quake 3 engine. Jedi Knight 2 was fairly late in the lifespan of OS 9 I think.
