Ranieri himself thinks this would be a bigger achievement than his Leicester season and there is a good reason why he thinks that.

In terms of trance, I initially thought 2018 was an diminishing year. While in the past few years, trance was undoubtedly my most listened to genre, and I would never miss an opportunity to go to a show, even if it artists I wouldn't normally listen to on my own, this year I started to burn out a lot . I probably listened to more progressive house and techno (combined) than trance at home, started digging way more into more experimental and IDM, and especially towards the second I have finally finished listening to my 2014 trance collection! It has taken almost 2 years, and 1500 songs, but I am done. After I had finished, I finally started writing this up, an idea I have harboured since I started. I wanted to do a short writeup of what 2014 sounded like, to act as a time capsule, and as a first step for anyone new to the genre. I will cover the many talents that represented Trance music well in 2014, acts I considered to have shone particularly brightly.

Ruud Gullit The 1987 Ballon D’or winner would be described in American sports media as a “unicorn”.

Dear football fans, This is a post dedicated to one of the best talents the Netherlands has produced in recent years, Royston Drenthe. Today is the today where he is returning to competitive football, having signed a contract with Sparta Rotterdam. His story however, began way earlier. - His first stint at Feyenoord 2000 - 2003 Drenthe was 14 years old when he got picked up by Feyenoord, having previously played in the youth ranks of Neptunus. Royston struggled, the intensity Over the last 3 years Sneijder’s a man who’s been as tagged, labelled and dubbed as much as anyone in electronic music.

Prepare those Vienna sausages and reheat your fish and chips folks, its time for another prestigious National Team tournament! As the corrupt Qatari dollars continue to rain down in FIFA headquarters amidst mass consumption of cocaine and hookers, 12 teams strive for an automatic qualification to the next orgy of financial excess. known as the 2020 Euros. Who will have their toxic fanbase gain even more smug superiority? Which managers will be fired for failure in a luck-based short tourna. A couple of weeks prior to the album release, I met up with Andrew, also known as Sneijder, in a hotel room in Stockholm, to get a personal guided tour throu. I think the quality of the team is pretty overrated. Best team since 2000. Oh c'mon. Serdar is no better than last year's Semih. Maicon, Fernando and Mariano are the only transfers that are better than their predecessors. Our offense is no better than last year's. I think we are even worse there, Gomis is the only power we have instead of 3 guy (Bruma-Podolski-Sneijder) sharing the weight. Belhanda is one of the worst transfers we ever had. Ndiaye is out of shape and pretty bad on offense. Over the last 3 years Sneijder 's a man who's been as tagged, labelled and dubbed as much as anyone in electronic music.

I hope everyone who looked at it enjoyed my Cities Cup (https://www.reddit.com/r/footballmanagergames/comments/6c6f3a/experimentthe_cities_world_cup_reworked_so_people/?st=j3df36ofampsh=c3868aa7), where people played for the city of their birth rather than their club. Here I ask the opposite question: who would win if everyone played for the nation they played their club football in, rather than their birth country? So Messi plays for La Liga, Zlatan plays for the Premier League Tipped in DJ Magazine by John O'Callaghan, "I'm tipping this guy to be massive" and praised by trance legend Paul van Dyk "An extremely exciting talent" Sneijder has not disappointed. 
I expect hate, read all the way through Ronaldo winning the Ballon d'or is an inevitability. Call it a 'disgrace' all you like it wont change the fact that it is happening and it will be deserved. There is absolutely nothing """""disgraceful""""""" about ronaldo winning the Ballon d'or , what nonsense, why are people acting like he has done nothing through this year and hasn't accomplished anything.

I tried to put this review up really fast, the idea was to make it before the sets become available to give you a feel for it. Needless to say, that was a FAIL :) So, after OU100 on NYE last year, the Toronto gang is back at it again for OU150! To my knowledge, this will be the only special event Simon has planned for the 150th episode so it's a special one. With me being back in Canada ahead of schedule, I had to attend. With all the intro José Mourinho is undoubtedly one of the most successful managers of all time. After a brief coaching stint at Benfica and União de Leiria, the 'Special One' broke onto the scene in the 2003-2004 season, leading Porto to Champions League glory at the Arena AufSchalke (Veltins Arena) in Germany. Since then his impressive haul of silverware includes domestic league titles (8), Champions League titles (2), Europa League titles (2) and cup titles (11). So, what is it exactly that has made Mourinho. Over the last 3 years Sneijder's a man who's been as tagged, labelled and dubbed as much as anyone in electronic music.

Howdy gents (and gals), Since tonight is St-Valentine's and we all know that trance fans don't have GFs that like this music, I figured I'd share my videos from last night's Ferry Tayle gig in Dallas in an attempt to explain to them why trance is Epic!! :P The show was at the same venue as Mark Sherry's Outburst OTC for Halloween. By "venue", I mean a Mexican restaurant in a shady part of town with a huge dance floor, some nice lights and a brand new laser setup! Sound system was OK actually.

I play with Juventus. Due to being poor, I can't play online (if you know what I mean). I don't like career (too much time spent on everything except playing games) and rotating players, because I have full team suitable for my style (except good left wing back Asamoah is shite with no first touch and taking forever to shoot and for now I play Isla there) and other players just aren't good enough (Pogba, for example, is just useless). So I just play friendlies on World Class. I play Juve's. Read and write album reviews for Everything Changes - Sneijder on AllMusic.
